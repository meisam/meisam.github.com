<p>I love the <code>any?</code> and <code>empty?</code> convenience methods that Rails and Ruby provide, they make conditional statements much easier to read. I also really dislike the default method of checking this behavior in jQuery:</p>
<pre name='code' class='js'>if ($('some.element').length &gt; 0) {
  // ...do something
}</pre>
<p>Well, luckily jQuery is ridiculously easy to extend, so why not just mix that functionality in with a couple of quick shot plugin methods? Just add this javascript sometime after you include jQuery:</p>
<pre name='code' class='js'>jQuery.fn.any = function() {
  return (this.length &gt; 0);
}

jQuery.fn.none = function() {
  return (this.length == 0);
}</pre>
<p>That&#8217;s all you have to do! Now we can make the same call as before, but it looks a little cleaner:</p>
<pre name='code' class='js'>if ($('some.element').any()) {
  // do something more readably...
}</pre>
<p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>:</strong> Apologies, I added in the <code>empty</code> bit as a last-second update to the post and forgot to check and realize that <code>empty()</code> is part of jQuery core. Updated the name to <code>none</code> instead.</p>
