<p>As of today, my blog and site are hosted on <a href="http://github.com/mbleigh/mbleigh.github.com">GitHub</a> and served through <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>. I switched to WordPress not too long ago but felt slightly disingenuous not using a Ruby-based solution. I had been using Jekyll for a couple of other projects (<a href="http://www.intrideauniversity.com/">Intridea University</a> and my wedding website) and decided to go ahead and go all out.</p>
<p>The look is mostly the same but I love that I can just pop into TextMate, work on a Textile file, push to GitHub and bam! I&#8217;m deployed. If you haven&#8217;t used the <a href="http://github.com/blog/272-github-pages">GitHub Pages</a> feature of GitHub I suggest you give it a try. It&#8217;s great!</p>
<p>The only downside is that the <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed will be resetting all of the unique IDs so you may get your feed reader spammed if you&#8217;re a subscriber. Also the comments are vanished once again (oops!) but I&#8217;m now explicitly setting Disqus permalinks so the next time I change my mind about how I want to run the site hopefully it will be better.</p>
