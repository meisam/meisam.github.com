<p>I recently wrote a guest post for the RubyLearning blog entitled <a href='http://rubylearning.com/blog/2010/11/30/how-do-i-build-dsls-with-yield-and-instance_eval/'>&#8220;How do I build DSLs with yield and instance_eval?&#8221;</a>. It gives a brief overview of how to use Ruby to build simple internal DSLs. Enjoy!</p>
