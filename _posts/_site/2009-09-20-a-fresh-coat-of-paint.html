<p>It&#8217;s been about six months since I moved this blog over to GitHub Pages and Jekyll, and that means that it&#8217;s about time for another site redesign. This time I decided to have a little bit of fun with some CSS3 features such as box shadow but I kept it simple.</p>
<p>Of course, as with the last page design (that I&#8217;ve been very happy to see many people adopt) you&#8217;re welcome to use this design in part or in whole for your own GitHub pages (the source is <a href="http://github.com/mbleigh/mbleigh.github.com">still available here</a>), but it might be a little more difficult due to the iconography and actual use of graphics.</p>
<p>Thanks, and I hope you keep reading!</p>
