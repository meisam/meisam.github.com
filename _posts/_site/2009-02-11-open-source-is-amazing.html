<p>Yesterday, I pushed by new, Jekyll-powered blog out to GitHub. That was 24 hours ago. Today, I get a note from Scott Chacon (GitHub guy and overall git guru) saying he liked my template and decided to use it for his site.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what&#8217;s so great about GitHub&#8217;s open source community: I shared it with no publicity or fanfare on my GitHub account and someone else found it useful and implemented it for their own site. I guess maybe some people don&#8217;t like others copying their site, I think it&#8217;s pretty great!</p>
<p>So if you like this little blog and open-source project display page, <a href="http://github.com/mbleigh/mbleigh.github.com/">fork away</a>! All that I would like in return is for you to let me know that you&#8217;re using it so I can check out your site.</p>
