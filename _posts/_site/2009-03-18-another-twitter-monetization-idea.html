<p>So everyone and their cat have made predictions about how <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a> will and could monetize (what, you haven&#8217;t heard of Sprinkles the economic forecasting cat?). I have one more idea, but it&#8217;s not because I think that this necessarily will happen so much as because I think it would be a fantastic feature to have for businesses on Twitter. The concept is &#8216;claiming&#8217; a hash tag.</p>
<p>Now the main Twitter interface pretty much ignores hash tags, but <a href="http://search.twitter.com/">Twitter Search</a> does not and I see it as a given that hash tags are here to stay. So for hash tags that have to do with an event, a company, or other kinds of definable entities there should be a special text advertising block that can be purchased at the top of the tag search that will allow the entity that the tag is about to explain and maybe provide a few links.</p>
<p>For example, with all of the <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=sxsw">endless tweets about <span class="caps">SXSW</span></a> I think it would be useful both for the <span class="caps">SXSW</span> organizers <strong>and for the people looking at the tag</strong> to have a block at the top that says something along the lines of &#8220;<span class="caps">SXSW</span> is a conference held yearly in Austin, TX that encompasses video, audio, and interactive media&#8221; with a couple of links to pertinent information. This provides a context to people clicking through to the Twitter Trends #<span class="caps">SXSW</span> tag who wouldn&#8217;t otherwise know much about the conference and gives <span class="caps">SXSW</span> another way to promote themselves.</p>
<p>This system would have to have some pretty stringent acceptance requirements, you wouldn&#8217;t want competitors to be able to claim their opponent&#8217;s tags etc. but I also think it has a lot of promise for providing a revenue stream for Twitter and actually useful information for users. I&#8217;m not a market prognosticator, and I think it&#8217;s actually pretty unlikely that this would come to pass, but I do think that it would be an interesting new way to advertise on the web.</p>
