<p>More and more web applications are providing external logins through sites such as Twitter, Facebook, and more.  It can be a bit of a pain to assemble suitable buttons for all of these services to display as the &#8220;<span class="caps">NASCAR</span> box&#8221; of logos for users to click when signing up or on to a site.</p>
<p>To make this a little bit easier, Intridea is releasing a collection of free and open-source logo buttons for use, well, however you&#8217;d like, but probably for these types of authentication scenarios. This collection is starting with twelve buttons:</p>
<p align='center'><a href='http://github.com/intridea/authbuttons' style='border:none'><img src='http://img.skitch.com/20100601-r69wti94eepdcb8ti3y6areqqi.jpg' alt='Logo Images'/></a></p>
<p>The initial set created are for Twitter, Facebook, Myspace, OpenID, Google, Yahoo, Basecamp, Campfire, Present.ly, Aol, LinkedIn, and GitHub.</p>
<p>This collection will grow over time as we get suggestions (or forks) of new iconography. The idea is simply to provide a clean, consistent set of icons that can be used to represent some of the web&#8217;s most popular services. Each icon is available in 32&#215;32, 64&#215;64, 128&#215;128, and 256&#215;256 PNGs as well as an Illustrator CS4 source file that contains all of the buttons and individual CS3 .<span class="caps">EPS</span> files that contain each button individually.</p>
