<p>Acts As Taggable On (<a href="http://intridea.com/2007/12/4/announcing-acts_as_taggable_on">original post here</a>), the tagging plugin with custom tag contexts, has gathered up some great new features over the past weeks thanks to the efforts of the community as well as <a href="http://www.intridea.com/people">fellow Intrideans Pradeep Elankumaran and Brendan Lim</a>. I just wanted to take this opportunity to go over some of what&#8217;s new and interesting in the world of <code>acts_as_taggable_on</code>.</p>
<h3>Community Fixes</h3>
<p>First, <a href="http://www.petercooper.co.uk/">Peter Cooper</a> was kind enough to submit a patch that allows <code>acts_as_taggable_on</code> to work with Rails 2.1&#8217;s <code>named_scope</code> when using <code>find_options_for_tag_counts</code>.</p>
<p>Secondly, the much requested support for Single Table Inheritance is finally in! It was just a matter of using a class inheritable attribute instead of a class instance variable, and big thanks to <a href="http://www.nicolasblanco.fr/">slainer68</a> for hunting that down and taking the time to submit a patch.</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s anything you&#8217;ve hacked on to Acts As Taggable On, I urge you to submit a patch to the <a href="http://mbleigh.lighthouseapp.com/projects/10116-acts-as-taggable-on">Lighthouse Project</a>. I try to get new patches integrated into the codebase as quickly as possible, so please do submit anything!</p>
<p>During the <a href="http://wiki.oreillynet.com/railsconf2008/index.cgi?CommunityProjectCodeDrive">Community Code Drive</a> at RailsConf two great features were added: taggers and related objects.</p>
<h3>Taggers</h3>
<p>Tags can now have ownership, allowing for such things as User-tracked tags and more. This was a requested feature and something that I&#8217;d been looking forward to myself. Here&#8217;s the usage:</p>
<pre name="code" class="ruby">class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_tagger
end

class Photo &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_taggable_on :locations
end

@some_user.tag(@some_photo, :with =&gt; "paris, normandy", :on =&gt; :locations)
@some_user.owned_taggings
@some_user.owned_tags
@some_photo.locations_from(@some_user)</pre>
<h3>Find Related</h3>
<p>Another request (and another great idea) is the ability to find related objects by similar tags. This is now available through the <code>@object.find_related_on_tags</code> syntax:</p>
<pre name="code" class="ruby">@bobby = User.find_by_name("Bobby")
@bobby.skill_list # =&gt; ["jogging", "diving"]

@frankie = User.find_by_name("Frankie")
@frankie.skill_list # =&gt; ["hacking"]

@tom = User.find_by_name("Tom")
@tom.skill_list # =&gt; ["hacking", "jogging", "diving"]

@tom.find_related_on_skills # =&gt; [&lt;User name="Bobby"&gt;,&lt;User name="Frankie"&gt;]
@bobby.find_related_on_skills # =&gt; [&lt;User name="Tom"&gt;] 
@frankie.find_related_on_skills # =&gt; [&lt;User name="Tom"&gt;] </pre>
<h3>Gemified!</h3>
<p>Acts As Taggable On now works as a GemPlugin in Rails. This is a new way (as of Rails 2.1) of distributing plugins as gems and having them still automatically link up and do their magic. To use it as a gem, add it to your <code>config/environment.rb</code> like so:</p>
<pre name="code" class="ruby">config.gem "mbleigh-acts-as-taggable-on", :source =&gt; "http://gems.github.com", :lib =&gt; "acts-as-taggable-on"</pre>
<p>Now you should be able to get the latest version of the plugin just by running <code>rake gems:install</code>. However, this hasn&#8217;t been working for me so the alternative is just to install the gem directly:</p>
<pre><code>gem install mbleigh-acts-as-taggable-on --source http://gems.github.com/</pre>
<p>Now when you run your Rails app, even though it&#8217;s not in vendor/plugins it should be running! To make sure, look for this line on startup:</p>
<pre><code>** acts_as_taggable_on: initialized properly</pre>
<p>There are still a couple of issues outstanding in Rails regarding GemPlugins (if you unpack it, it will not run the initialization properly for some reason), but I wanted to give everyone the latest and greatest way to install the plugin possible. It will still work fine using the conventional methods as well.</p>
<h3>Community and Future</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve been really happy with the response and support of the community, and I would like to do everything possible to cultivate future participation. To that end, I have created an <a href="http://www.actsascommunity.com/projects/acts-as-taggable-on">Acts As Community Project</a> for <code>acts_as_taggable_on</code> that will hopefully provide some casual communication about the project. Feel free to post on the wall or in the forums, and look out for additions soon.</p>
<p>Finally, the area of the plugin that still needs some work is tag caching. This is not a particular area of my expertise, so I&#8217;m hoping that someone from the community will write up some specs that flesh out the caching functionality in new and interesting ways.</p>
<p>Thanks for all of the patches, and I hope you continue to enjoy using Acts As Taggable On!</p>
<p><b><span class="caps">UPDATE</span> (6/10/08):</b> The improvements keep on rolling! After writing the post, I went off on a tangent and decided to make the plugin work both traditionally and as a gem. See more details above in the &#8220;Gemified&#8221; section.</p>
