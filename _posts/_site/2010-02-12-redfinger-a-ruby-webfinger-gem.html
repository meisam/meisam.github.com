<p>Just yesterday, Google <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_enables_webfinger_for_google_profiles_email_as_identity.php">turned on webfinger for all GMail accounts</a>. Today, I&#8217;m releasing a RubyGem to help you use the new protocol!</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s a WebFinger?</h3>
<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/">WebFinger</a> is a new protocol for extracting public information about a person via their e-mail address. It is meant to complement systems such as OpenID as well as give a simple way to get basic information about a user without having to ask them for it.</p>
<p>E-Mail providers can implement WebFinger by creating a special <span class="caps">URL</span> (specifically at <code>/.well-known/host-meta</code>) that is an <span class="caps">XRD</span> <span class="caps">XML</span> document telling the requester a <span class="caps">URL</span> at which they can find out more about e-mail addresses on their domain. Google&#8217;s, for example, is <code>http://www.google.com/s2/webfinger/?q={uri}</code>. When the WebFinger endpoint is requested with an e-mail address in place of <code>{uri}</code>, Google looks up information about that e-mail&#8217;s public profile and provides it in a standardized <span class="caps">XRD</span> <span class="caps">XML</span> format.</p>
<p>So why WebFinger when OpenID already exists? Users are used to associating their e-mail address with their identity. It&#8217;s natural since an e-mail address is (usually) for a specific person. By putting a protocol in place to find out more about an e-mail address without requiring additional input from the user, a host of options become available.</p>
<p>For instance, if I&#8217;m an application looking to authenticate using OpenID, I can ask a user for their e-mail address instead of their OpenID <span class="caps">URL</span> (something that will confuse mainstream users to no end). Or, if I want to automatcially fill in basic profile information, I can check to see if a parseable profile page is available in a format such as hCard.</p>
<h3>Enter Redfinger</h3>
<p>Redfinger is a library built to easily consume the WebFinger protocol. Installing it is simple:</p>
<pre>gem install redfinger</pre>
<p>Using it is just as simple:</p>
<div>
<pre>
<code class='ruby'>require 'rubygems'
<p>require &#8216;redfinger&#8217;</p>
<p>finger = Redfinger.finger(&#8216;youraccount@gmail.com&#8217;)<br />
finger.open_id.first.to_s # =&gt; &quot;http://www.google.com/profiles/youraccount&quot;</code><br />
  </pre></p>
</div>
<p>Redfinger will query the host of the e-mail domain specified, and, if the Webfinger protocol is supported, retrieve information about that e-mail address including such links as OpenID Provider, hCard <span class="caps">URL</span>, and more.</p>
<p>How can you use this today? Well, if you&#8217;re an OpenID consumer you can use the above code to try to &#8220;intelligently find&#8221; an OpenID endpoint from an e-mail address. Of course, it will just about only work with Google at the moment (this is an alpha protocol, after all). Or, you could install the <code>mofo</code> gem (a gem for parsing microformats for web pages) and do some neat things with microformats:</p>
<div>
<pre>
<code class='ruby'>require 'rubygems'
<p>require &#8216;mofo&#8217;<br />
require &#8216;redfinger&#8217;</p>
<p>finger = Redfinger.finger(&#8216;account@gmai.com&#8217;)<br />
card = hCard.find(finger.hcard.first.to_s)<br />
card.fn # =&gt; &quot;That GMail user&#8217;s full name&quot;<br />
card.title # =&gt; &quot;The title he/she entered on Google Profile&quot;</code><br />
  </pre></p>
</div>
<p>Here Redfinger determines a <span class="caps">URL</span> that will have hCard information about the e-mail address specified, and the Mofo gem goes out and fetches that address, parsing out the information.</p>
<p>WebFinger is still brand new (Google calls it &#8220;alpha&#8221;) but it shows some promise for being a great way to make the open web more seamless for users. As always, <a href="http://github.com/intridea/redfinger">the Redfinger source code is available on GitHub</a> and <a href="http://rdoc.info/projects/intridea/redfinger">RDoc Documentation</a> is available.
