title: Pitfall for Egypt
---

Egypt is passing a vitally important time in his history now. Egyptins had a revolution last year and now it's time for elections to send the elected people to the parliment. But what is going on there does not seem to be promising. Islamic and extremist parties are getting momentum in Egypt that may turn Egypt into a worst dictatorship. 

"If they fear God, they wont be bribed." That is what one of the Egyptions said when she asked why she supports the Islamic parties in the election. The bitter fact is that "If they fear God, they will do ANYTHING in his name."

I was born and lived many years in one of those Islamic countries where religion rules. I really know what it means to have a theocaric goverment. And I promise you that it is nice at all. My people had a revolution 32 years ago and overthrown the king and establishe an Islamic government based on the rules of sharia. What happened 32 years ago in my county is not very different from what is going on in Egypt right now. Islamic parties shouted eye-cany slogens at the begining of the revolution. They promised to bring justice, they promised to abolish poverty, they promised to follow the rules of sharia. And, yes, they convinced people that "Since they fear God, they wont be bribed". But now after 32 years, have they done what they have promised? Answer is no, they have not and they wont.

Read the history of our revolution. There are a lot of lessons to learn.
