title: First Impression of a Professor
---
I'm taking a course this quarter with "Michael Bond":http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~mikebond a young and enthusiastic professor in the "CSE":http://cse.osu.edu department. Today, he had a talk today about his research interest which is dynamic program analysis for detecting concurrency bugs. It is very likely that I'll be working with during my studies and I'm really glad. He knows a lot of dominant people in the field of programming languages (like "Kathryn McKinley":http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mckinley) and I wont be surprised to see in near future that Mike becomes a magnate in this field.
