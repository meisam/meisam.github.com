title: To Swim 1,000 Kilometers
---
I'll be in USA for at least 5 years to do my PhD (Phew). Last week I made an ambitious decision to swim 1,000 kilometers while I'm here. 1,000 kilometers in 5 years means 200 kilometers each year, or almost 4 kilometers each week, or almost 500 meters each day. It's been two weeks since I made the decision but I've swam just 7 kilometers which clearly means I'm behind the schedule. I hope I can make it. 

This decision to swim 1,000 kilometers probably keeps me busy (and in shape, I hope) for a few years. But it also dashes out one of my biggest dreams. Until very recently one of my dreams was swimming the distance from South America to Africa across the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic's width is more than "2,848 kilometers between Brazil and Sierra Leone":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean. This means that even if I I want to swim this distance in 2 months during my summer holidays, I have to swim 12 times more each day which is almost 6 kilometers each day! 6 Kilometers per day is far beyond my capabilities. I'm quite sure that swimming 6 kilometers a day in an infinite mass of blue is extremely boring. Fortunately, I was wise enough to give up my dream of swimming across the Pacific Ocean from Japan to South America which is about six times more .
