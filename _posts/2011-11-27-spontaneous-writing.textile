title: Spontaneous writing
---

In my first language, I was keeping dairies for many years. I was writing something almost everyday for 5 years. And that was one of the most valuable things that I've had in my life. But before moving to the USA, in a special ceremony that I established, I brought them to the top of a peak and burned them. It took roughly less than 2 hours to burn them all and as the pages of each diary book was burning in fire, I was looking at it and thinking about what had happened in the past years and I was thinking about what may happen after that.

8 years ago, when I started keeping dairies, I had one and only one goal: practicing writing by writing everyday. I clearly remember that I started writing because one o my teachers recommended us to do it. He recommended us to take a piece of paper everyday and start writing without thinking. Writing without thinking filled many pages of my dairies with nonsense sentences. But at the same time it helped me develop a sense of confidence in myself such that writing was not an arduous task for me anymore.

No, after 8 years, I'm doing the same thing, but this time in a different language. What I'm seeking is developing confidence when I I write in English. What appears on this weblog is not supposed to be (and wont be) sane. It would merely help me write better and nothing more.
