title: A Robot Describes Meaning of Life
---

I installed Jeannie the other day on my Android tablet and I was using it quite often. Sometimes you can ask tough questions and it turns out to be quite smart in answering them. I was asking questions such as "What time is it in Berlin?", "Do I need to take the umbrella with me today?", or even "Who was the president of the united states when Britney Spears was born?". I also command it with command such as "Remind me to go to the meeting tomorrow at 4:30." or "Wake me up at 6:45" and it turns out that it is quite good.

The funniest thing about Jeannie is that I showed it to a friend of mine who is a good geek and asked him to test it. The very first question that he asked was "What is the meaning of life?" which is an unusual question. My reaction to the question was "That's not fair." but to my surprise, Jeannie answered the question. I'm not gonna tell you what the answer was. If you want to know the answer you can try it yourself.
