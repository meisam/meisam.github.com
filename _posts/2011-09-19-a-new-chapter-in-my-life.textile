title: A New Chapter in my Life
---

Finally, I moved out of the Wonderland. But my concerns seem to stay with me at least for a long time, if not for ever. Sometimes I think I'm a coward who escaped from all the difficulties he had. Sometimes I think I was not brave enough to stay and fight. But anyway, it's too late to keep my mind busy with these thoughts. Timid or brave, I'm done with that.

My brother has to make a life changing decision in a month or so. He has two choices and we all know which one is the best one for him. By "we" I mean, my brother, my parents, my sisters, my brother's doctor, all the other doctors in the committee, and I. But for reasons that are too complicated for me to understand, my brother has to choose the second option, which we all know is the worst choice.

I extremely feel bad when I think about what my brother has to do, partially because I cannot do anything about it. But mainly, it's because of this bitter fact that nothing needed to be like this. Everything could be fine! I wish it was.

I do not know what can I do and I do not know how much time and energy it takes, but I do know that I'll do whatever it takes.
